Getting Started with FW/1
Framework One - is a family of small, lightweight, 
convention-over-configuration frameworks, primarily for CFML.
FW/1 itself provides MVC, DI/1 provides dependency injection 
(a.k.a. inversion of control),
and AOP/1 provides aspect-oriented programming features on top of DI/1.
